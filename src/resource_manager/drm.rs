//! DRM backend: open display-capable cards (`/dev/dri/cardN`) as DRM master
//! and register each as `Resource::Drm { card }`.
//!
//! Compiled only with the `drm` feature (default). The master fd never
//! leaves the server: every grant creates a FRESH lease over the card's
//! objects (see [`DrmDevice::grant_lease`]) and revocation is
//! kernel-enforced. Registration order IS the advertised priority order
//! (first is best): the card selection logic lives here with the open.
//!
//! A card's life is a type-state machine — [`DrmDeviceState::Locked`]
//! (master held, leaseable) or [`DrmDeviceState::Leased`] (master + one
//! live lease). Transitions consume the state and return `Result<Next,
//! Self>`: an ioctl failure hands back the state you were in, so a card can
//! never be lost or double-leased — the failure path is a retry, not a
//! leak. The state lives behind `Mutex<Option<...>>` because the engine can
//! push a Revoke for one task while another task runs a grant on the same
//! card (see docs/resource-manager.md).
