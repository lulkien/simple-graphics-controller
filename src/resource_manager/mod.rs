//! Open and register every available resource (video + input). Ownership is
//! NOT tracked here anymore — that is the policy engine's job.
//!
//! Backends are compile-time features (see docs/resource-manager.md):
//! `fbdev`, `drm`, and `input` each live in their own module behind a
//! `#[cfg(feature = ...)]`. Default features: `drm` + `input` — an unbuilt
//! backend is never opened, registered, or advertised; the engine denies
//! Acquires against it with "not registered". The protocol crate is
//! deliberately ungated (the wire format must not depend on the build).
//!
//! [`open_resources`] returns the advertised list in priority order:
//! clients read it top-down, so the first entry of a kind is the best
//! match (the first DRM card is the display card).
